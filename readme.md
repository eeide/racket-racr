# Documentation

A short [synopsis](racr/documentation/synopsis.md) gives an overview what _RACR_ is all about; also consider its [feature list](racr/documentation/introduction.md#racr-features). For documentation consult _RACR's_ [reference manual](racr/documentation/title.md). Besides _RACR's_ application programming interface, it provides detailed [installation instructions](racr/documentation/requirements-and-installation.md). To get started, [documented examples](examples/examples-overview.md) are in the `./examples` directory.

Besides _Racket_, _RACR_ can also be used as _C#_-library. The [_RACR-NET_ manual](racr-net/documentation/title.md) describes its application in _.NET_ using _C#_; though, it assumes familiarity with _RACR's_ basic functionalities.

There also exists a list of [scientific publications and presentations](publications.md) regarding RAG-controlled rewriting, _RACR_ and its applications.
